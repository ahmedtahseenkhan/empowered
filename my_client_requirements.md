General Privacy Practices
Cookies and Tracking:
We use cookies and other tracking technologies to enhance platform functionality and analyze user behavior. You may disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may affect certain features.

Content Flow Observations
Menu flow seems logical:
 Find a Mentor → My Mentors → Notes from Mentor → My Courses → Buy a New Course → FAQs.
 However, right now “Buy new Course” and “Find a Mentor” are below “FAQs” in a separate block, which might imply they are less important — but they’re actually high-action features.
 Consider grouping all action items together at the top.


If “Mentor Notes” is important after each session, it could be nested under “My Mentors” for cleaner navigation.


You might want a "Dashboard / Home" item so students can always jump back to this main panel after navigating deeper.




Main Panel
"Authorize" button — function is clear, but button label could be more descriptive:


"Authorize Google Calendar"
 “Authorize this platform with your Google account to sync your events so you stay updated and get the most from your calendar.”

 Before EmpowerEd, I struggled to keep my students on a routine. Now, sessions are automatically scheduled, payments are handled, and reminders keep me on track. I finally feel in control of their learning without doing all the admin work myself.
Hasnain S. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This platform made me feel like a true professional. My profile was verified within a day, and the video intro feature really helped students connect with me before booking. I got three recurring students in the first week!
Fatima N. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
 Safety and quality were my biggest concerns with online tutoring. Knowing that all mentors are verified gave me peace of mind. Plus, the free trial made it easy to test before committing. Highly recommended to any parent.
